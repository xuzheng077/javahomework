/**
 * A simplified version of CSV Reader.
 *
 * Subclass of a BufferedReader to handle a character stream that consists of
 * comma separated values (CSVs)
 *
 * Provides an additional instance method, readCSVLine(), that parses lines into
 * substrings. The substrings are separated by comma in the original input
 * stream. The readCSVLine() method returns an array of references to Strings.
 * The Strings are the values from the line that were separated by commas. If a
 * value was surrounded by quotes, the quotes are removed.
 *
 * Limitations: Spaces before or after the commas are not removed. In the first
 * and last quote are removed from a value. Embedding commas in a quoted value
 * is not handled properly. (In this case, the commas will separate the values
 * and the quotes will not be removed from the ends of those values.
